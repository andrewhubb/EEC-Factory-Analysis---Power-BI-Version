# EEC-Factory-Analysis---Power-BI-Version
EEC Factory Analysis Dashboard using Data from Thai Government Data Playground

This is a dashboard using data from the Thai Government Data Playground website https://data.go.th/ this dashboard uses a csv file containing details of factories in the Eastern Economic Corridor.
This Power BI version is a reworking of the dashboard that I created in Excel using the same data. It was possible to copy the Power Query code from Excel and paste it into Power BI. The only change I had to make
was to remove leading and trailing space names from field names. These spaces caused an invalid field name error in Power BI. But in Excel there was no problem.
